How to Play – Antimatter Dimensions
</div>
<hr>
<div style="text-align: center">
Antimatter Dimensions is an Idle Incremental game with multiple layers of unlocks, prestige, and achievements. The basic Goal is to reach infinity and receive an infinity point, which can be spent on various skills to increase your overall production.

<div style="text-align: left" id='div1' class='hidden'>
<b>Dimensions:</b>
<br>
Dimensions are your production units in game.  The first Dimension produces your Antimatter.  Each consecutive dimension produces the previous one, allowing you to have steady growth. There are eight dimensions total.
<br>
<b>Dimension Multiplier:</b> Beside the dimension there is a multiplier (example: First Dimension x1.0). The base production of each dimension is multiplied by this number.  This multiplier increases by 2x(Base) for every 10 of that dimension purchased.
<br>
<b>Accumulated Dimension Quantity:</b> The next column is your current amount of that dimension you own. This is a combination of how many you have purchased with antimatter, as well as produced from the higher dimension.
<br>
<b>Purchased Dimensions Quantity:</b>  Next to each accumulated quantity of owned dimensions, the amount of that dimension purchased toward the next multiplier upgrade is displayed in brackets.  If you have (4) next to your accumulated dimension quaintly, you will need 6 more of that dimension for the next multiplier increase.
<br>
<b>Dimension Growth Percent:</b>  This number represents the amount of growth that dimensions experiences per second. +100% means the dimension is doubling each second.  This allows you to judge overall growth.
<br>
<b>Cost & until 10:</b> You can buy a single quantity of each dimension with antimatter when the cost button is highlighted.  Alternatively, if the Until 10 buttons is highlighted, you can buy whatever quantity gets you to that dimensions next dimension multiplier.
</div>
<hr>
<button onclick='changestate(2)' class="storebtn">Ticks</button>
<div style="text-align: left" id='div2' class='hidden'>
<b>Tick:</b> Production in the game happens on each “tick”.
<br>
<b>Interval:</b> The length of time between ticks. This is lowered by purchasing tick interval reductions.
<br>
<b>Cost:</b> The cost of antimatter for reducing the tick interval by the % displayed above (initially 10%).
<br>
<b>Buy Max:</b> This will buy the maximum amount of tick interval decreases available with your current amount of Antimatter
</div>
<hr>
<button onclick='changestate(3)' class="storebtn">Dimension Shift</button>
<div style="text-align: center" id='div3' class='hidden'>
<b>Dimension Shift:</b>
<br>
Dimension Shift resets your current game, but unlocks another dimension for your next run. It also increases the multiplier of lower dimensions. The requirements for the shift will be displayed during your run. Each shift increases power 2^(Resets-(tier-1)  (Minimum 1).
</div>
<hr>
<button onclick='changestate(4)' class="storebtn">Dimension Boost</button>
<div style="text-align: center" id='div4' class='hidden'>
<b>Dimension Boost:</b>
<br>
Like a Dimension Shift, a Dimension boost resets your game. No new Dimensions will be added, but the base dimension multipliers will increase. Each boost increases power 2^(Resets-(tier-1).
</div>
<hr>
<button onclick='changestate(5)' class="storebtn">Antimatter Galaxies</button>
<div style="text-align: center" id='div5' class='hidden'>
<b>Antimatter Galaxies:</b>
<br>
Purchasing an Antimatter Galaxy will reset your game back to the point where only 4 Dimensions are available, but will increase the effect of your tick speed interval reduction by 2% (Example: 10%->12). Though it will have very little impact for the first few purchases, the increase is multiplicative and won’t take long to be visible.
</div>
<hr>
<button onclick='changestate(6)' class="storebtn">Max All</button>
<div style="text-align: center" id='div6' class='hidden'>
<b>Max All:</b>
<br>
Max all will purchase multiple items based on your current Antimatter.  Max all prioritizes tick speed, then the “until 10” buttons of Dimension 8, and down from there. Max All is not intended to play the game for you, so it’s prioritization will not be changed.  Auto buyers are available late game for automated runs.
</div>
<hr>
<button onclick='changestate(7)' class="storebtn">Dimensional Sacrifice</button>
<div style="text-align: center" id='div7' class='hidden'>
<b>Dimensional Sacrifice:</b>
<br>
Sacrificing will immediately reduce the owned quantity of dimensions 1 through 7 to zero. This does not reduce the multiplier or the current cost.  In return, it will multiply the “Eight Dimension Multiplier” by the shown value.  It will take time to get back to the production you previously had, but with an increase.
<br>
<b>When should I Sacrifice?</b> Depends on your percentages (+%/s), but if they are over ~2% and the multiplier is over 2x, I'd say it's worth it. The lower the percentage, the longer it takes to gain back your dimensions.
<br>
<b>Dimensional Sacrifice Checkbox:</b> This allows you to complete dimensional sacrifices without having the warning popup.
</div>
<hr>
<button onclick='changestate(8)' class="storebtn">Infinity</button>
<div style="text-align: center" id='div8' class='hidden'>
<b>Infinity:</b>
<br>
Once you have too much Antimatter for the world to handle, you’ll reach infinity and be able to perform a “Big Crunch”. This will unlock a new tab with a selection of skills.  Each infinity you complete awards an Infinity point that can be spent on this tab.
</div>
<hr>
<button onclick='changestate(9)' class="storebtn">Achievements</button>
<div style="text-align: center" id='div9' class='hidden'>
<b>Achievements:</b>
<br>
Each achievement has conditions that must be meant before they are earned.  Some are very simple, and some are significantly trickier.  You may have to infinity, or start a challenge, before attempting some of the harder ones.
</div>
<hr>
<button onclick='changestate(10)' class="storebtn">Challenges</button>
<div style="text-align: center" id='div10' class='hidden'>
<b>Challenges:</b>
<br>
Challenges change in game mechanics in different ways to create more difficult infinity circumstances.  Each completed challenge will award an auto buyer.  You can run them multiple times, and they can be exited at any time via the “Exit Challenge” button on the challenge tab.
</div>
<hr>
<button onclick='changestate(11)' class="storebtn">Autobuyers</button>
<div style="text-align: center" id='div11' class='hidden'>
<b>Autobuyers:</b>
<br>
Once unlocked you can enable and disable autobuyers via the infinity tab.  Autobuyers can be upgraded to work faster, and some have multiple buy options to help optimize your runs.
