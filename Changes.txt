So you get one infinity point for reaching infinity (1.7e308), game also tracks time it takes to get it.
There would be an infinity upgrade tree and challenges.

Upgrades:
multiplier for 10 dimensions bought 2x -> 2.2x
production increase over time +0.5*(minutes)^0.8%
Multiply the production of 2 Dimensions at a time, sets could be 1,8 ; 2,7 ; 3,6 ; 4,5 and multiplier is 1+(Infinitied*0.2)
Production multi based on challenges (full challenges give x3 to all dimensions)
Decrease the number of dimensions needed for resets by 9


Challenges:
All dimensions produce 50% less antimatter
More production initially, with lowering with time(1000% first, after 1 hour 100%, after 2 hours 10%)
except for the first dimension, all dimensions are less efficient for every higher dimension purchased (mult = 1/2^(highestDimension - ThisDimension))
You can't increase tick speed
You start with 8 Dimensions but can't reset
Buying anything halts your progression to 10%, gradually returning in 3 minutes


Challenge rewards:
Buy 1 Dimension every 30 seconds?
